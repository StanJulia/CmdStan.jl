## Prerequisites

For more info on Stan, please go to <http://mc-stan.org>.

The Julia package CmdStan.jl is based on Stan's command line interface, 'cmdstan'.

The 'cmdstan' interface needs to be installed separatedly. Please see [cmdstan installation](https://github.com/StanJulia/CmdStan.jl/blob/master/docs/src/INSTALLATION.md) for further details. 

The location of the cmdstan executable and related programs is now obtained from the environment variable JULIA_CMDSTAN_HOME. This used to be CMDSTAN_HOME.

Right now `versioninfo()` will show its setting (if defined).

## Note

Release 5.0.0 of CmdStan.jl is a major level update as it breaks several examples. The simplest way to revert back to the pre-5.0.0 behavior is to use the ```output_format=:array``` option in the call to StanModel().

Latest registered version is v5.0.2.

By default a call to stan() will now return an MCMCChains.Chains object (which has been derived from the Mamba.Chains object). The Chains object has facilities for summarizing, diagnostics, plotting and further processing.

CmdStan.jl has been tested on cmdstan v2.19.0 (released 3/20/2019). I have not played around with the brand new GPU possibilities!
